The Big Little Theatre Company Inc is thrilled to present an exciting and fresh take on William Shakespeare’s classic comedy, Two Gentlemen of Verona. This lively and fun-filled adaptation tells a tale of friendship, betrayal, and love as Proteus follows his best friend Valentine to fashionable Milan, only to become infatuated the same woman Valentine has met and intends to marry. Will Proteus’ scheming lead to his triumph? or will true love prevail? The answer is a mystery —but seeing how the characters get there is a heap of fun. Don’t miss this unforgettable production bought to you by Ashburton’s very own young people’s theatre training company. A night filled with laughter, romance, and more than a touch of mischief is promised.
