<br>
The Big Little Theatre Company returns in April with a bold and visually inventive production of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Renowned for producing outstanding young performers and theatre of exceptional quality, BLTC Inc. brings Mark Haddon’s much-loved story to life through dynamic ensemble work, imaginative staging, and powerful storytelling. Following the extraordinary journey of Christopher - a teenager who sees the world differently - this moving and funny production explores mystery, family, and courage with warmth and originality. A compelling, high-quality theatre experience that is highly recommended - and likely to sell out. Book early.        <br>
