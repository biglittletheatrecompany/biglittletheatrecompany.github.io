<p><em>“After 10 years of gracing the Mid-Canterbury stage, you know what to expect when you walk into a show put together by the rising stars of the Big Little Theatre Company.  That’s a polished, well put together and brilliantly executed performance featuring remarkable young talent”</em><br />
(Ashburton Guardian, Nov 23, 2019: “A Shakespearean Masterpiece”)</p>

<h2 id="the-big-little-theatre-company-presents-the-importance-of-being-earnest">The Big Little Theatre Company presents: <em>The Importance of being Earnest</em></h2>

<p>A trivial comedy for serious people</p>

<p>Jack is in love with Gwendolen. Algernon is in love with Cecily. Cecily is Jack’s ward. Gwendolen is Algernon’s cousin. Jack told Gwendolen his name was Earnest. Algernon told Cecily his name was Earnest. Neither Jack nor Algernon are actually called Earnest but of course Gwendolen and Cecily both think their love is called Earnest. Maddie and Morgan cant find Earnest anywhere on Instagram, someone misplaced a baby and Quin is just happy to be here.</p>

<p>Confused ? Good.
You’ll just have to come along for a fun filled evening out to make sense of just who Ernest is and why he is so important.
A Comedy of Falsehoods, wit and questionable societal norms, Big Little Theatre Company’s reimagining of Oscar Wilde’s the Importance of being Earnest will have you laughing out loud and hungry for a muffin.</p>

<p>Presented by The Big Little Theatre Co.
Adapted and Directed by Nomi Cohen.</p>
