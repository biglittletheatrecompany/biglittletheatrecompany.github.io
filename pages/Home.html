                     This is a tale about the wonders of stories, the ingredients that make them extraordinary, and the importance they hold in our hearts.
                     Join our young heroes and the strange characters of Story Grove as we explore the magical world of storytelling and find our way back home through the power of imagination! Uniquely devised and written specifically for the children in the cast, this tale is inspired by their own creative suggestions. Come along, and you too will discover that in the world of Story Grove, you simply can’t be a nobody—everyone is a somebody, shaped by the magic tucked within the pages of every story.
