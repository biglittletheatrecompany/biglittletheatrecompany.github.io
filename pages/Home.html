                            Big Little Theatre Company presents the tragi-comedy <em>Well, Thank You, Thursday</em>, adapted for the stage for the very first time.  Boldly presented on a traverse stage, the play explores a day in the life of a number of disparate lives. The stories of the richly depicted characters ultimately come together at the local registry office, an office which anchors key moments in our lives: birth, marriage, death. 
<br>
                            The play is adapted from a little-known British television script, written in 1976 by  BAFTA-award winning Jack Rosenthal.
